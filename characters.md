<h2> project description </h2>
<p>Author explores capabilities of neural networks in generating textual information (GPT-3) as well as images (ruDall-E) and video (Illustrip 3D). Research addresses the blurred boundaries in the definition of normality and deviance in the realities of the future, superimposed on a world consumed by the “Metaworld”, the virtual counterpart of the overarching social network. Identities are blurring, economic polarization is intensifying, anxiety is growing, and despite the availability of posthumanist upgrades of personal abilities, addictions and loneliness are intensifying.</p>

<p>The recently updated WHO medical classifier of diseases has added gaming addiction and a number of other illnesses to its contents. Speculative methods help to explore the question of interpreting normality in the context of virtual everyday life. Physically embodied Meta Disorders Classifier, will contain new formulations of "diseases" such as Virtomnemia (obsessive memories of a virtual event), Multipersonality Meta disorder (MPMD) and others. </p>

<p>MDC #22 is not only a handbook: there are stories of "patients" - avatars trapped in the reality of MetaCloud, striving to achieve dreams, trapped in their own anxieties and passions. Each character has a portrait and a story, created or augmented with the help of neural networks. </p>

<p>A free interpretation of GIF animation - lenticular postcards are used for depicting the characters. They are as tangible as artistic canvases and create a sense of volume and movement when viewed from different angles. The avatars' faces and backgrounds are also generated by a neural network. This creates an effect of understatement and intrigue that is embedded in the work and references the Sufi philosopher Attar's work "The Conference of the Birds" and is the main mystery of the work, accessible to the attentive visitor.</p>
