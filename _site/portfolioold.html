<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I am a multimedia artist, studying at the University of Arts Bremen, Germany (Digital Media M.A.), with a legal, human rights and project management background.<br />
I am interested in how new media affect social environment.<br />
I embody my interest in the wide diversity of projects - creating digital media art, video performances, installations, applied design and organizing events, making sound experiments and field recordings, designing online media 
for human rights sector, data analysis and visualization for journalistic materials.<br />
I believe that new interactive and immersive data-driven media are an important component of communication strategies for two-way interaction with the audience.</p>

<p>Is this flow of information trying to mimic reality? Or is this all our interpretation? Let’s focus on something simple. And metal.<br />
The author set out to explore the possibilities and principles of analog frame-by-frame animation, supplemented by real-time digital image processing.<br />
The result is a short animated film about a universe in which nails, an allusion to the digital environment trying to mimic real-world objects.</p>

The work draws attention to the problems of Russian civil society and the state’s attempt to liquidate the International Memorial, organization protecting the memory of victims of political repression.</p>

<p>Rough and minimalist animated sketches, inspired by the work of William Kentridge, use the textures and shapes of real metal hacksaw blades as a backing. The looping, morphing, unrefined design, framerate shifting video tracks and soundtrack based on the same metal saw blades, create a sense of growing menace.<br />
The project continues to explore the capabilities of idiosyncratic hardware-software system for creating non-standard step-by-step animation.<br />

Breathing of the performers captured by sensors was their own adventure of finding within the soundscape entities connected to their own scenario and communicate with them.

It gets data from a laser distance sensor (LIDAR) as well as analog input via 6 buttons and a pressure sensor for triggering and changing individual sound parameters - frequency, modulation, filtering.

   <td>This term paper explores the interpretation of time and space in the works and interviews of Timothy Morton and Kodwo Eshun, as well as researchers of the topic of environmental criticism, Afrofuturism, and Sonic fiction, by simulating fictitious dialogue in an imaginary environment, with these authors and Oswald Wiener as moderator. The search for interconnections in their approaches draws attention to the importance of the role of language, logic and politics in shaping the perception of time and space. They are changeable in the direction from a monopolistic future and linear time to a multiple futurality free from the predominance of constructions of appropriation and restriction of access.

Events for attorneys who care about the future of the community


## Idea
   <td>Russian Bar is part of civil society, but it is fragmented and its rights are constantly violated by law enforcement state agencies and the court. Events of Golos Advokata (“Voice of Bar”) project in various regions of Russia are designed to bring together active members of the community, provide an opportunity to exchange experiences and convey the views of lawyers to the public and the media.
