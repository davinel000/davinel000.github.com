# Viacheslav Romanov creative portfolio
### 27.01.22 - starting to build portfolio in YAML file. 
### 04.02.22 - current version
## Principles: 
# 1. Keeping porfolio clean and simple (visual and website preferences are generated by layouts and additional elements)
# 2. Informative commenting (structural, contents)
# 3. Gradual developing (placeholding is a further dev = names, instruments)

# Structure ideas:
# 1. Separate base for instruments (name, link)
# DONE! 2. Separate base for authors (name, link)
# 3. Store illustrations in project folders (title = folder name, cover in root, subfolders - activities)


about_me:
  - I am a multimedia artist, studying at the University of Arts Bremen, Germany (Digital Media M.A.), with a legal, human rights and project management background.  I am interested in how new media affect social environment.  
  - I embody my interest in the wide diversity of projects - creating digital media art, video performances, installations, applied design and organizing events, making sound experiments and field recordings, designing online media for human rights sector, data analysis and visualization for journalistic materials.  
  - I believe that new interactive and immersive data-driven media are an important component of communication strategies for two-way interaction with the audience.

      idea: Is this flow of information trying to mimic reality? Or is this all our interpretation? Let's focus on something simple. And metal. The author set out to explore the possibilities and principles of analog frame-by-frame animation, supplemented by real-time digital image processing. The result is a short animated film about a universe in which nails, an allusion to the digital environment trying to mimic real-world objects.

      idea: The author continues to develop interactivity tools for developing step-by-step animations. The result was a short film about the learned helplessness of citizens in the face of repressions, embodied in the image of the teeth of a metal saw. The work draws attention to the problems of Russian civil society and the state's attempt to liquidate the International Memorial, organization protecting the memory of victims of political repression.

      long: Rough and minimalist animated sketches, inspired by the work of William Kentridge, use the textures and shapes of real metal hacksaw blades as a backing. The looping, morphing, unrefined design, framerate shifting video tracks and soundtrack based on the same metal saw blades, create a sense of growing menace.

      long: 15 virtual sound sources were flying around the audience with filtering parameters controlled separately and randomly by 4 performers in a quadro sound setup. 5 temporal phases meant different stages of sensible sleep, connected to different sets of sound (falling asleep, travelling, escaping from a chase, finding harmony and washing out with rain and sea). Breathing of the performers captured by sensors was their own adventure of finding within the soundscape entities connected to their own scenario and communicate with them.

      idea: The impossibility to plan and foresee, the lack of trust in authorities, media and statistics, the anxiety had already built a different mental state in people involved in that. The idea of the project is to reflect and try to reproduce the state of the fake environment, loneliness and anxiety through 3 key elements - digital content, material embodiment and a physical interface to connect them. Visitor doesn't have any capability to change the covid stats, the news and the way people on the streets behave.

      idea: An empty, freshly created and still untouched space of the new leisure complex had completely white walls which were ideal for creating light installations. For this reason, the author decided to select his video footages on architecture thematic - brick buildings of abandoned factories, concrete colonnades of viaducts, road junctions and bridges. In the symbolic act of video performance, the history of places filled with meaning and experience of the past comes into contact with a completely new environment of the future but leaves no material mark.

      long: Author decided to embody the musical instrument in the form of a sci-fi gun. It became a fierce means of Sonic Fiction in the form of a console gamepad, attaching an interface to the basic concept of pointing at the target. It uses the Klangstrom board platform and incoming digital and analog signals to generate and process a real-time audio. It gets data from a laser distance sensor (LIDAR) as well as analog input via 6 buttons and a pressure sensor for triggering and changing individual sound parameters - frequency, modulation, filtering. Gives the possibility to modify the signal processing settings to obtain a different sound character within Arduino environment.

      long: Most of the composition is based on the number of daily and total infections, deaths and recoveries in the world (from the covid observer portal), and Apple mobile activity index (how often users navigated every day). The rhythmic and emotional picture of growing anxiety is formed through binary transformations, minor scales and frequency modulations based on weekly and monthly dynamics. Using the Wellen library for Processing language (developed by Dennis Paul), the author is experimenting with the available classes and methods and plans to create various generative works based on data from cities and countries around the world.

Interaction with the created instrument is showing the significance of the chosen observation point, the trajectory of movement, as well as the environment itself, as they allow to fill the sequence of recorded data, a kind of "choreography".

      long: Distance data is obtained through the laser distance-measuring sensor (LIDAR) and saved as individual sequences to an SD card.  Sound indication allows you to get an idea of the characteristic of the sound in real time. The collected data can be processed in any program working with text files. The device also allows you to send current distance signals via USB cable to the serial port. 
      presentation: The work was developed during the course "AutomationDistribution – Sites, Technologies, Politics" by Prof. Henrik Nieratschker (WiSe20-21).

      idea: The general idea of the product is to provide a choice of patterns and colors that reflect the individual characteristics of the user. Adjustable glow color allows the user to project the inner world and his or her emotional state on the surrounding objects. In addition, the decorative lamp was made affordable and easy to manufacture (including the possibility of self-assembly and painting)

      idea: By frequently using navigation maps the user becomes stick to the schematic representation of spece rather than to real environment and its landmarks, which leads to the issues with corellating between them. The solution may be found in a navigational mode, aimed to help users with orientation in space by using landmarks and decision points instead of street names

      long: The idea is to lesser the timeuse of navigational software, mitigate “dark concepts of HCI”, and help users to better memorize key visual inputs and build stronger orientation connections. 
      presentation: The concept, including description and animated illustrations, was presented during the course “Interface/Interaction Design” by Prof. Peter von Maydell, HfK Bremen (WiSe 20-21)

      idea: Discussions about the nature of matter, the relationship between time and space are a component of a whole philosophical branch, including questions of ontological, epistemological nature. The aim of the work is to explore and present the views of Kodwo Eshun and Timothy Morton, in the context of their interpretations of the concepts of time and space, associations with the creative and cultural practices of electronic music, to illustrate and model them in the format of a reproduced dialogue.

      long: This term paper explores the interpretation of time and space in the works and interviews of Timothy Morton and Kodwo Eshun, as well as researchers of the topic of environmental criticism, Afrofuturism, and Sonic fiction, by simulating fictitious dialogue in an imaginary environment, with these authors and Oswald Wiener as moderator. The search for interconnections in their approaches draws attention to the importance of the role of language, logic and politics in shaping the perception of time and space. They are changeable in the direction from a monopolistic future and linear time to a multiple futurality free from the predominance of constructions of appropriation and restriction of access.
