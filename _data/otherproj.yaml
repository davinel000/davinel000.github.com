    #   long: The content of a study is embodied in a data investigation long read with interactive infographics. The data source was public information about donations of citizens and organizations to Russian political parties in 2015. We, as Infometer Project Center team at the "DataStories" hackathon (Saint Petersburg, 2015),  analyzed open information about several thousand donations (from 1 EUR to 500K EUR), public procurement and profiles in social networks and visualized it. We identified suspicious identical amounts of donations and connections between donors, “fake parties” with similar identities who received donations from members of other pro-government parties. Violations of donation limits for individual parties have been discovered. Large donations of the same amount from large businesses for getting the opportunity to take place in the party governing bodies were found. A gender and age portrait of donors of various parties was built.
