about_me:
- I am a multimedia artist, studying at the University of Arts Bremen, Germany (Digital
  Media M.A.), with a legal, human rights and project management background.  I am
  interested in how new media affect social environment.
- I embody my interest in the wide diversity of projects - creating digital media
  art, video performances, installations, applied design and organizing events, making
  sound experiments and field recordings, designing online media for human rights
  sector, data analysis and visualization for journalistic materials.
- I believe that new interactive and immersive data-driven media are an important
  component of communication strategies for two-way interaction with the audience.

  idea: Is this flow of information trying to mimic reality? Or is this all our interpretation?
    Let's focus on something simple. And metal. The author set out to explore the
    possibilities and principles of analog frame-by-frame animation, supplemented
    by real-time digital image processing. The result is a short animated film about
    a universe in which nails, an allusion to the digital environment trying to mimic
    real-world objects.

    in the face of repressions, embodied in the image of the teeth of a metal saw.
    The work draws attention to the problems of Russian civil society and the state's

    board platform and incoming digital and analog signals to generate and process
    a real-time audio. It gets data from a laser distance sensor (LIDAR) as well as
    analog input via 6 buttons and a pressure sensor for triggering and changing individual
    sound parameters - frequency, modulation, filtering. Gives the possibility to
    modify the signal processing settings to obtain a different sound character within

    attention to the importance of the role of language, logic and politics in shaping
    the perception of time and space. They are changeable in the direction from a
    monopolistic future and linear time to a multiple futurality free from the predominance
    of constructions of appropriation and restriction of access.
