## Idea

The "Edit Wars" project delves deep into the phenomenon of state-controlled information manipulation, especially pronounced during Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. By artistically interpreting Russian propaganda, this initiative seeks to heighten awareness and foster resistance against such manipulations.

"Edit Wars" is a transdisciplinary project that fuses data journalism with art to decipher and artistically interpret Russian propaganda narratives. Originating in the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the project seeks to uncover the state's manipulation and control over information. Using tools like the GDELT Global Difference Graph (GDG) databases and the BERTopic algorithm, the project analyzes over 250,000 news headlines from Russian-language media. This research unveils the distorted reality propagated during the invasion, serving as a foundation for the project's subsequent artistic endeavors, such as the "Propaganda Narrative Soundscapes" installation.

## Research Methodology

Within the information bubble created by the Russian authorities, propaganda narratives are woven to present an alternative history. "Edit Wars" dissects these narratives, sourced from Russian state-approved digital media between January and July 2022. Using advanced tools like GDELT Global Difference Graph (GDG) databases, BERTopic algorithm, and visualization platforms like Tableau and the Spacy library, the project unveils the distorted reality propagated during the Russian invasion.

Goals of the project include deconstructing Russian propaganda, developing data analysis tools, studying the dynamics of propaganda in media, promoting critical thinking, and crafting artistic interpretations of research insights.

## Web Platform: [editwars.org](https://editwars.org/)

Editwars.org visualizes research findings and dissects key propaganda themes and techniques. This online platform showcases the cultivation of enemy imagery, imperial resentment, and the "Newspeak" of state propaganda.

## Interactive Installation: “Propaganda Narrative Soundscapes”

This installation transforms narratives into auditory and visual experiences, offering a deeper understanding of propaganda mechanisms. It encompasses an "Outside" space for analysis and an "Inside" room symbolizing aggressive news dissemination.

## Interactive Installation: “Propaganda Narrative Soundscapes: Dashboard”

This installation, adapted for portable format, presents the detailed research insights of the Edit Wars project in a dashboard interface, combining them with realtime propaganda websites load on the second screen, and a sonified feedback within 3 7-minute soundscapes, with temporal and topical touchscreen navigation.
