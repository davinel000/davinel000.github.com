## Idea

An empty, freshly created and still untouched space of the new leisure complex had completely white walls which were ideal for creating light installations. For this reason, the author decided to select his video footages on architecture thematic - brick buildings of abandoned factories, concrete colonnades of viaducts, road junctions and bridges. In the symbolic act of video performance, the history of places filled with meaning and experience of the past comes into contact with a completely new environment of the future but leaves no material mark.

## Long Description

The work is based on author's video footages, filmed in Saint Petersburg in 2019 (Red Triangle abandoned factory, West Speed Diameter and Kanonersky island). The music scene was based on a custom SoundCloud playlist, consisting of instumental and ambient tracks. The selection, processing of content and the creation of effects was carried out right during the performance.

## Presentation

Bring Your Own Beamer Festival, opening of Lines Space, Saint Petersburg, 23 November 2019. The footages were also used during BYOB Bremen, 2021
