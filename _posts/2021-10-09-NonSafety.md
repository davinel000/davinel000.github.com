## Idea

The author continues to develop interactivity tools for developing step-by-step animations. The result was a short film about the learned helplessness of citizens in the face of repressions, embodied in the image of the teeth of a metal saw. The work draws attention to the problems of Russian civil society and the state's attempt to liquidate the International Memorial, organization protecting the memory of victims of political repression.

## Long Description

Rough and minimalist animated sketches, inspired by the work of William Kentridge, use the textures and shapes of real metal hacksaw blades as a backing. The looping, morphing, unrefined design, framerate shifting video tracks and soundtrack based on the same metal saw blades, create a sense of growing menace. The project continues to explore the capabilities of idiosyncratic hardware-software system for creating non-standard step-by-step animation. Class �Trickfilmkurs� by prof.
