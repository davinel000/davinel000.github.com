## Idea

"In the Style of" is a series of AI-generated graphic pieces, manifested in an interactive installation, exploring the challenges of articulating critical political artistic expression under conditions of war and state censorship. Despite being distanced from direct political threats, artists often grapple with indirect pressures, fostering unease, fear, and guilt. The installation blurs the boundaries of authorship, combining traditional artistic techniques with AI-generated imagery.

## Long Description

The artwork leverages canvas and projection mapping to convey its poignant message. AI-generated images, derived from potentially sensitive prompts, produce generative metaphors and interpretations of contemporary events, constituting the installation's artistic language. The work draws inspiration from artist Felix Nussbaum, who painted amidst political repression. Generative pieces, informed by Nussbaum's experiences, utilize early generative models of Disco Diffusion, enhancing the metaphorical depth. The art, debuted at Hochschultage 2022, was later adapted for the Brixen Water Light Lab, demonstrating its versatile exhibition potential.

## Presentation

Initially showcased at Hochschultage 2022 (Hochschule für Künste Bremen, July 2-3, 2022) as a two-layered installation, "In the Style of" was later adapted for the Brixen Water Light Lab (May 3-21, 2023) in the medieval Kloster Neustift's reading room.
