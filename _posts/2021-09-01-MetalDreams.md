## Idea

Is this flow of information trying to mimic reality? Or is this all our interpretation? Let's focus on something simple. AMetal Dreams delves into the realm of analog frame-by-frame animation, juxtaposed with real-time digital processing. Using simple metallic elements, like nails, it plays with the concept of the digital world emulating tangible objects, questioning our interpretation of reality.

## Long Description

To implement the project, the author built a specialized hardware-software complex for recording and processing frame-by-frame animation. The main material used in the animation is metal nails of various sizes. Class �Trick der Sterne� by prof. Kati Barath, Ulrike Isenberg (WiSe20-21)
