## Idea

Inspired by projects to sonify the biological properties of the coronavirus spike protein, the author sought to reproduce in musical generative form the open statistical data on coronavirus infection (from January 2020 to April 2021).

## Long Description

Most of the composition is based on the number of daily and total infections, deaths and recoveries in the world (from the covid observer portal), and Apple mobile activity index (how often users navigated every day). The rhythmic and emotional picture of growing anxiety is formed through binary transformations, minor scales and frequency modulations based on weekly and monthly dynamics. Using the Wellen library for Processing language (developed by Dennis Paul), the author is experimenting with the available classes and methods and plans to create various generative works based on data from cities and countries around the world.

## Presentation
