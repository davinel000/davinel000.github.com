## Idea

"Clean It Up!" is a 2D third-person point-and-click apartment-cleaning simulation game. The player's mission is to assist the main character, a university student, in tidying up his apartment in the days leading up to his birthday. But it's not just about cleaning; the protagonist must also balance his work, studies, daily chores, and fluctuating moods and energy levels. With only six days left until the big celebration, the race against time adds an extra layer of challenge.

## Long Description

The game, set within the confines of a rented apartment, offers a unique blend of strategy, time management, and narrative. The environment, depicted in a hand-drawn minimalist style, becomes a reflection of the protagonist's life, filled with tasks, distractions, and moments of relaxation. The player must navigate through this space, making decisions that will impact the character's mood, energy, and the state of the apartment. Can you ensure that the apartment is spotless before the birthday celebration?

Developed for the PC Windows platform using Unity 3D during the "Entertainment Computing" course at the University of Bremen under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Rainer Malaka and Dr. Dmitry Alexandrovsky, "Clean It Up!" offers a relatable and engaging experience. It's more than just a game; it's a reflection of the challenges many face in their daily lives, trying to balance responsibilities while also taking care of their well-being.
