## Idea

**umbra** is a live media performance built as a feedback loop between body, sound, and a computational double.  
It questions the boundary between the human performer and a system that observes, remembers, and responds — a *digital shadow* that is at once a reflection and an agent.

At its core, **umbra** unfolds through three overlapping layers:

- the **extractivist layer**: what traces do we leave when our data is harvested — and who owns the digital double?  
- the **psychological layer**: shadow as the repressed, drawing on Jungian and mythological archetypes  
- the **ontological / epistemological layer**: what is a shadow, where does it begin, and how autonomous can it become?  

Memory becomes an instrument: past gestures return as material for the next decisions, turning the performance into a living archive.

## Experience

On stage, a motorized semi-transparent screen structure forms a **3×3m kinetic cube**.  
It opens and transforms during the performance, functioning alternately as **container**, **stage**, and **projection surface**.

The cube acts as a compositional and symbolic device: an “ideal room” of encapsulation and extraction.  
When closed, it frames the performer as if inside a controlled chamber — a space where observation and capture intensify.  
When it opens, shadows and body “spill” outward, shifting the choreography from containment to release — and, later, to re-capture.

Performer **Chi Him Chik** engages with his improvisation machine **Aiii** and the multimedia instrument **Type-0《零式》**, generating live sound and light.  
Media artist **Slava Romanov** designs real-time visuals, depth-sensor tracking, and projection mapping — making the digital shadow appear as point-cloud bodies, particles, and AI-reinterpreted figures that answer the performer back.

The audience witnesses a fragile dialogue between body and double, shadow and source, analogue and digital — a choreography of presence and disappearance.

## Composition (7 acts)

- **Intro** — bodyless contour → intentional encapsulation  
- **Development / recording gestures** — exposition, absorption, classification, emerging conflict, shadow overtake, breakout  
- **Body as “Truth”** — Type-0《零式》 performance  
- **Aria of umbra**  
- **Encounter & improvisation** — a multitude of reimagined twins  
- **Reverse aria** — separation toward autonomy, then trapping the shadow back into synergy  
- **Outro** — resolution

## Visual system (real-time)

The visual layer of **umbra** is built as an instrument: a real-time pipeline that observes the performer, constructs a 3D shadow-body, mutates its rules, and reprojects it back into the scenography.

**Two intertwined logics shape the visuals:**

1) **Audio-reactive immediacy**  
Onset-driven events, dynamics, and rhythmic impulses articulate particles, density shifts, and abrupt transitions — keeping the image tied to live physical energy.

2) **Internal system states**  
“Physiological” values such as **breath** and **heartbeat** from **Aiii** act as slower, structural controls — shaping the temperament of the shadows: persistence, delay, instability, drift, and intensity.

**Visual language** moves between two poles:  
- reduced, high-contrast **white point constellations on black**, flowing and mutating as a legible “data-body”  
- occasional transitions into **colorful, more figurative AI reinterpretations**, where the same embodied stream is translated into unstable image-memory — not as background video, but as a responding agent.

**Toolchain / setup**: TouchDesigner + Resolume; **3× Azure Kinect**; **2 PCs** in the visual subsystem.

## Technology

- **Kinetic screen structure** — semi-transparent, motorized cube (3×3m), opening/closing as an active scenographic gesture  
- **Depth cameras & point cloud tracking** — live 3D shadow-body and motion-based interaction  
- **Type-0《零式》** — katana-inspired multimedia instrument with motion sensors, LED strip, and wireless data/audio  
- **Aiii** — improvisation machine by Chi Him Chik, an algorithmic persona reacting across sound and control streams  
- **AI image synthesis (real-time)** — driven by the same embodied data stream, transforming point-cloud shadows into unstable image-memory  
- **Shared control layer** — synchronization across gesture, sound, and image through system-state signals and triggers

## Workshops

After the performance, an interactive workshop invites audience members to step inside the kinetic screen structure, try sensors and instruments, and learn how sound, visuals, and shadows are produced in real time.  
The workshop fosters transparency, discussion, and shared experimentation around AI and media art.
