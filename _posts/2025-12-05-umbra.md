## Idea

**umbra** is an innovative media performance that questions the boundaries between human and machine, focusing on the concept of the *shadow* as both digital reflection and psychological metaphor.  

At its core, umbra investigates three overlapping layers:  
- the **extractivist** layer: what traces do we leave when our data is harvested, who owns our digital double?  
- the **psychological layer**: shadow as the repressed, drawing on Jungian and mythological archetypes.  
- the **ontological/epistemological layer**: what is a shadow, where does it begin, and how autonomous can it become?  

The performance uses feedback loops between performer and technology to create “digital shadows” that visually and sonically amplify the performer’s physical presence.

## Experience

On stage, a motorized semi-transparent screen structure forms a 3×3m kinetic cube. It opens and transforms during the performance, functioning alternately as container, stage, and projection surface.  

Performer **Chi Him Chik** engages with his improvisation machine *Aiii* and the multimedia instrument *Type-0《零式》*, generating live sound and light. Media artist **Slava Romanov** designs real-time AI visuals, depth-sensor tracking, and projection mapping, creating shifting layers of human figure, silhouette, and machine-interpreted shadow.  

The audience experiences a dialogue between body and double, shadow and source, analogue and digital — a fragile choreography of presence and disappearance.

## Technology

- **Kinetic screen structure** — semi-transparent, motorized, opening/closing cube, extending the scenography.  
- **Depth cameras & point cloud tracking** — to generate real-time virtual shadows and motion-based interactions.  
- **Aiii** — improvisation machine by Chi Him Chik, an algorithmic “persona” reacting with sound and image.  
- **Type-0《零式》** — katana-inspired multimedia instrument with motion sensors, LED strip, and wireless audio/data.  
- **AI visual generation** — real-time reinterpretations of performer’s body, projected onto multiple layers.  
- **Multichannel improvisation soundscape** — responsive acoustic system, combining live input and algorithmic output.

## Workshops

Each performance is followed by an interactive workshop. Audience members are invited to step inside the kinetic screen structure, try the sensors and instruments, and learn how sound, visuals, and shadows are produced in real time. The workshops foster transparency, discussion, and shared experimentation around AI and media art.
