## Idea

The general idea of the product is to provide a choice of patterns and colors that reflect the individual characteristics of the user. Adjustable glow color allows the user to project the inner world and his or her emotional state on the surrounding objects. In addition, the decorative lamp was made affordable and easy to manufacture (including the possibility of self-assembly and painting)

## Long Description

Experimenting with patterns and forms, adding manual finishing assembly and painting, we tried to find the most interesting and non-standard combinations.
