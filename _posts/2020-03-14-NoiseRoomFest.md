## Idea

Visualization of intangible rhythm, cyclicity, symmetry and harmony of music, through a combination of natural landscapes and geometry

## Long Description

The work is based on author's video footages, filmed in Morocco, Berlin and the Leningrad region in 2019. Reflex hunt for rhythm and symmetry was the core theme and was revealed through the spray of a waterfall, blossoming flowers and man-made structures, shifting and changing one to each other in combination with complex geometries.

## Presentation

Museum of Sound, GES-21 (Gallery of Experimental Sound 21), Saint Petersburg, 14 March 2020. The footages were also used during BYOB Bremen, 2021.
