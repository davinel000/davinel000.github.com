## Idea

Discussions about the nature of matter, the relationship between time and space are a component of a whole philosophical branch, including questions of ontological, epistemological nature. The aim of the work is to explore and present the views of Kodwo Eshun and Timothy Morton, in the context of their interpretations of the concepts of time and space, associations with the creative and cultural practices of electronic music, to illustrate and model them in the format of a reproduced dialogue.

## Long Description

This term paper explores the interpretation of time and space in the works and interviews of Timothy Morton and Kodwo Eshun, as well as researchers of the topic of environmental criticism, Afrofuturism, and Sonic fiction, by simulating fictitious dialogue in an imaginary environment, with these authors and Oswald Wiener as moderator. The search for interconnections in their approaches draws attention to the importance of the role of language, logic and politics in shaping the perception of time and space. They are changeable in the direction from a monopolistic future and linear time to a multiple futurality free from the predominance of constructions of appropriation and restriction of access.
