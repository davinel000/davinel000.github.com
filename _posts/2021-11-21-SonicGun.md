## Idea

The author created a tool for reproducing the synesthetic equivalent of the distance between objects in space in a form of a physical interface that playback sound with different characteristics. The author strived for creating an artifact that provides playful interaction and easy development and updating.

## Long Description

Author decided to embody the musical instrument in the form of a sci-fi gun. It became a fierce means of Sonic Fiction in the form of a console gamepad, attaching an interface to the basic concept of pointing at the target. It uses the Klangstrom board platform and incoming digital and analog signals to generate and process a real-time audio. It gets data from a laser distance sensor (LIDAR) as well as analog input via 6 buttons and a pressure sensor for triggering and changing individual sound parameters - frequency, modulation, filtering. Gives the possibility to modify the signal processing settings to obtain a different sound character within Arduino environment.
