## Idea

By frequently using navigation maps the user becomes stick to the schematic representation of spece rather than to real environment and its landmarks, which leads to the issues with corellating between them. The solution may be found in a navigational mode, aimed to help users with orientation in space by using landmarks and decision points instead of street names

## Long Description

The idea is to lesser the timeuse of navigational software, mitigate �dark concepts of HCI�, and help users to better memorize key visual inputs and build stronger orientation connections.

## Presentation

The concept, including description and animated illustrations, was presented during the course �Interface/Interaction Design� by Prof. Peter von Maydell, HfK Bremen (WiSe 20-21)
