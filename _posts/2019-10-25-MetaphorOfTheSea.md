## Idea

The experience of creating an immersive and interactive environment for musical expression and perception of the sea through direct and indirect associations.

## Long Description

The work reveals the idea and atmosphere of the sea through the effect of immersion in a three-dimensional interactive sound and visual environment. A user in the Oculus Rift moves through a tunnel built of adjectives describing the sea. To move, the user must play his own unique melody on the electronic calimba. During the journey, the user is surrounded by luminous and sounding models of marine life.

## Presentation

"Metaphor of the Sea" was successfully presented on "Form of Communication" visual art festival in Saint Petersburg, Russia as the graduation work of students of the course "Visual programming in Kvadrat Youth Center"
