## Idea

The impossibility to plan and foresee, the lack of trust in authorities, media and statistics, the anxiety had already built a different mental state in people involved in that. The idea of the project is to reflect and try to reproduce the state of the fake environment, loneliness and anxiety through 3 key elements - digital content, material embodiment and a physical interface to connect them. Visitor doesn't have any capability to change the covid stats, the news and the way people on the streets behave.

## Long Description

The project was implemented as an interactive  video installation consisting of 1) a dummy painted cardboard wall with a window, 2) projection screen with a video lapse of a city street (Saint Petersburg, Russia, window view during self-isolation), 3) LCD screen with daily covid statistics and news headlines, 4) Controller interface (Arduino) for navigating within the timeframe of the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic  (01.04.2020-01.07.2020 - 1 frame per 20 seconds)). 4) The work was developed during the course "Art +/&&|| Design" by prof. Henrik Nieratschker (WiSe20-21).
