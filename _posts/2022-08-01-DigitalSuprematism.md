## Idea

Digital Suprematism dives deep into the avant-garde art movements of Suprematism and Abstractionism, translating their foundational principles of form, color, and composition into a computational context. The aim is to construct a generator capable of producing avant-garde images that embody the spirit and aesthetic of these movements, while also allowing for variation through user-defined parameters.

## Background

Suprematism, with its emphasis on basic geometric forms and a limited color palette, has long been a beacon for artists looking to express abstract concepts through visual means. The movement's pioneers, like Kazimir Malevich and Nikolai Suetin, forged a path that sought balance, harmony, and efficiency in their compositions. Digital Suprematism seeks to walk this path, but with the added dimension of algorithmic design and interactivity.

## Long Description

This project, realized in the Processing environment, is an exploration and reinterpretation of Suprematism in the digital realm. The core of the generator is built upon ArrayLists, holding shape data, and uses Perlin noise algorithms for organic value distributions. The resultant images are not just random assortments of shapes and colors; they are informed by the theories and compositional principles of Suprematist artists.

The generator offers a level of interactivity, allowing users to influence the generation process. This interactivity is a nod to the ever-evolving nature of art and the role of the viewer in the artistic experience.

The approach is focusing on fundamental artistic principles rather than mere shape and color randomness and ensures that each generated image is a meaningful representation of Suprematist ideals.

## Presentation

Digital Suprematism was created as part of the "Algorithmic Thinking with Processing" course under the guidance of Professor Frieder Nake. The project was exhibited as a testament to the convergence of art and technology, serving as a bridge between traditional Suprematist principles and contemporary generative art practices.

## Technical Details

The installation is based on the Processing programming language, a tool tailored for artists. It employs a variety of algorithms and data structures, such as Perlin noise and ArrayLists, to generate its images. User interaction is a key component, allowing for a dynamic and ever-changing artistic experience.
