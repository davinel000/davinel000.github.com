## Idea

Representation of Curiosity as the inner core of digital utopia and an unconscious desire to ask a question to the reality.

## Long Description

The work was built by mixing generative graphics and prerecorded video and adapted for demonstaring on a large media facade of Yeltsin Center with unusual shape (2200 square meters). It consisted of three parts, representing the process of transition from Curiosity to action, variability and the desire to capture attention as well as the collective experience as a source of identity formation in the digital environment.
