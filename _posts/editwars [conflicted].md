The Edit Wars project is a research-based endeavour that focuses on the manipulation and control of information by the state, creating a one-sided worldview. This became evident in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Consequently, the project aims to deconstruct, debunk, and artistically interpret Russian propaganda narratives, thereby raising awareness and resistance against information manipulation.

## The Project Scope

The project unfolds in a transdisciplinary manner, incorporating:

- Data research
- Web-platform development
- Interactive installation creation

## Research Methodology

The narratives under investigation are viewed as a self-created accumulation of interconnected events. These are manipulated through propaganda to influence public perception. The research involves analyzing propaganda narratives generated by Russian state-approved digital media from January to July 2022. 

Tools employed include:

- GDELT Global Difference Graph (GDG) databases [[Link](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/announcing-the-gdelt-global-difference-graph-gdg-planetary-scale-change-detection-for-the-global-news-media/)]
- Machine learning tools like BERTopic algorithm
- Visualization tools like Tableau and Spacy library

The [methodology](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-l0Eehe_5LkzkVgGjkDR78s6Fi4z-BOFgKY5JUEinQ/edit) is published open source. In 2023, this methodology was [reused](https://www.szabadeuropa.hu/a/magyar-orosz-putyin-kormanypropaganda-cimek/32407272.html) by journalists for an article about Russian propaganda narratives in Hungary.

## Web Platform: [editwars.org](https://editwars.org/)

Editwars.org is an online platform visualizing the research findings and exploring key themes, messages, and propaganda techniques. It serves as a hub for publishing interactive longreads and analyses.

## Interactive Installation: “Propaganda Narrative Soundscapes”

The installation offers an immersive view of propaganda, representing narratives as soundscapes based on analyzed datasets. It comprises of two elements: an “Outside” space, where propaganda tendencies are deconstructed and analyzed, and an “Inside” room, representing an aggressive news emitter in a confined space.

This installation was [exhibited](https://www.hfk-bremen.de/t/neuigkeiten-und-presse/n/kooperation-des-studiengangs-digitale-medien-der-hfk-bremen-mit-edit-wars) in Tor40 (Güterbahnhof Bremen) on February 2-5, 2023 and was featured by [TAZ](https://taz.de/Kunstprojekt-Edit-Wars-in-Bremen/!5909071/) and [Buten un Binnen](https://www.butenunbinnen.de/videos/ausstellung-gegen-propaganda-kunst-darstellung-100.html).
