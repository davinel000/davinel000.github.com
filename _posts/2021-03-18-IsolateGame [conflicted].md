## Idea

"Isolate" is an arcade game that draws inspiration from the COVID-19 pandemic's societal need for distancing. Through a simple mouse-driven control scheme, players guide a ball through a 2D space, aiming to evade or obliterate constantly spawning adversaries, while embodying the essence of keeping distance in a challenging environment.

## Presentation

Developed during the course "First steps into Creative Coding with Processing" under the guidance of Professor Peter Buczkowski, "Isolate" showcases the application of creative coding techniques to produce an engaging arcade experience. The game is built using the Processing framework and incorporates the Wellen generative audio framework, demonstrating the potential of these tools in game development.

## Long Description

Set in an abstract 2D world, "Isolate" challenges players to use strategy and quick reflexes to avoid or destroy adversaries. The main character, a ball, is endowed with a finite set of lives, losing one with each adversary collision. Over time, the character amasses light mines which can be strategically deployed against the pursuing balls, turning the tables on the chase. With each adversary destroyed, players earn points, adding a competitive edge to the gameplay.

The game's object-oriented design, with distinct classes for various game elements, ensures a smooth and engaging gameplay experience. It serves as both a reflection on the challenges faced during the pandemic times and a testament to the versatility of the Processing platform in game creation.
