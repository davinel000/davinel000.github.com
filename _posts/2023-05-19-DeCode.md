## Idea

The De:Code tech party at the Polyester Klub in Oldenburg delved into the challenges and opportunities presented by artificial intelligence in both day-to-day life and creative fields. This event served as a platform for engaging public discussions and showcasing works of digital art, particularly focusing on the generation of images via neural networks.

## Long Description

The exhibition was an exploration into the realms of image generation through AI, examining both traditional and avant-garde approaches. It aimed to demonstrate how AI could act as an extension of the artist's hand, offering a wide variety of overlaying techniques and noise values. The event also emphasized the importance of non-standard solutions and a critical approach to the infiltration of generative art in everyday life and media landscapes.

## Presentation

The event took place on May 19, 2023, at the Polyester Klub in Oldenburg. It was a tech party dedicated to AI, featuring an open discussion forum and an art exhibition. The artworks generated for this event reflected a broad spectrum of techniques and conceptual approaches, catering to both the layman and the expert.
