## Idea

A rethinking of distance between objects, by reproducing its characteristics through alternative artistic means of expression (generative sound, video). Interaction with the created instrument is showing the significance of the chosen observation point, the trajectory of movement, as well as the environment itself, as they allow to fill the sequence of recorded data, a kind of "choreography".

## Long Description

Distance data is obtained through the laser distance-measuring sensor (LIDAR) and saved as individual sequences to an SD card.  Sound indication allows you to get an idea of the characteristic of the sound in real time. The collected data can be processed in any program working with text files. The device also allows you to send current distance signals via USB cable to the serial port.

## Presentation

The work was developed during the course "AutomationDistribution ï¿½ Sites, Technologies, Politics" by Prof. Henrik Nieratschker (WiSe20-21).
