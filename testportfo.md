# Viacheslav Romanov creative portfolio

## About me         
I am a multimedia artist, studying at the University of Arts Bremen, Germany (Digital Media M.A.), with a legal, human rights and project management background.  
I am interested in how new media affect social environment.  
I embody my interest in the wide diversity of projects - creating digital media art, video performances, installations, applied design and organizing events, making sound experiments and field recordings, designing online media 
for human rights sector, data analysis and visualization for journalistic materials.  
I believe that new interactive and immersive data-driven media are an important component of communication strategies for two-way interaction with the audience.

### Motto
Curious eyes gaze into sparks in the night sky. It is filled with movement that carries messages. 

## Idea
Is this flow of information trying to mimic reality? Or is this all our interpretation? Let's focus on something simple. And metal.  
The author set out to explore the possibilities and principles of analog frame-by-frame animation, supplemented by real-time digital image processing.  
The result is a short animated film about a universe in which nails, an allusion to the digital environment trying to mimic real-world objects.

## Name
Non-Safety

## Year
2021

## Format
stop-motion

## Category
Generative graphics, performances, interactive installations

## Motto
Violence at the door slices the world around us with its iron teeth. Do we close our eyes enough to deal with it?

## Idea
The author continues to develop interactivity tools for developing step-by-step animations. The result was a short film about the learned helplessness of citizens in the face of repressions, embodied in the image of the teeth of a metal saw.  
The work draws attention to the problems of Russian civil society and the state's attempt to liquidate the International Memorial, organization protecting the memory of victims of political repression.

## Content
Rough and minimalist animated sketches, inspired by the work of William Kentridge, use the textures and shapes of real metal hacksaw blades as a backing. The looping, morphing, unrefined design, framerate shifting video tracks and soundtrack based on the same metal saw blades, create a sense of growing menace.  
The project continues to explore the capabilities of idiosyncratic hardware-software system for creating non-standard step-by-step animation.
